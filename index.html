           Did you know that according to Four Paws (2021), cattle move frequently and can go 13 km per day during grazing? This is one of the reasons why cattle are so helpful. Cattle are also visually intelligent. They can differentiate colors, shapes, and sizes of the same shape. They can also recognize photographs of other cattle that they know. (Barnes, 2020) <br><br>


<b><i>Cattle</b></i> have a huge role in the economy because they are livestock animals. Livestock animals produce a variety of consumer goods and they provide labor that can be a big help to our economy. They provide us with leather, beef, and dairy products such as milk and cheese. They can are also used as riding animals and draft animals. Not only do they benefit the community, but they also benefit the environment by reducing the risk of range fires. When grass gets too tall and dry, a range fire may occur, burning thousands of acres that can destroy habitats for animals and can threaten our homes. Cattle can help prevent this. “When cattle graze the lands they reduce the length of the grass, just like humans do when they mow their lawn.” (Idaho Beef Council, 2023)<br><br>


There are numerous effects that cattle have on our environment. These effects can either help develop our country’s economy, making it a good effect, or it can destroy our environment, making it a bad effect. According to Gaeng (2023), “Cattle, for instance, produce more greenhouse gases than any other species of livestock, accounting for about 10% of global emissions.” It is also said by Harder (2015) that cattle are a major contributor of methane and this can be as much as 25 times the impact of carbon dioxide in our environment. Greenhouse gases can cause serious environmental problems such as global warming and climate change which can cause extreme weather, wildfires, and shortage of resources. (Gaeng, 2023)<br><br>

Imagine a world without cattle. Imagine if one day, they go extinct. Sure there will be less greenhouse gases being emitted in our environment but that would also mean that we would get less resources. We would have to live a life without milk to go with our cereal or coffee, and no cheese to go with our bread and spaghetti. The farmers would also do twice as much of their work because they would have less animals to be used for riding and drafting. Our country’s economy would also drop rapidly. “There would likely be substantial economic repercussions if cattle went extinct. Millions of people around the world rely on the income, livelihood, and security that cows provide. If cows disappeared from the planet, these resources would disappear with them.” (Gaeng, 2023)<br><br>

            The Ardea insignis, commonly known as the white-bellied heron or the imperial heron, is an endangered species found in the eastern Himalayas of northeast India, Bhutan, and northern Myanmar.<br><br>

     According to HeronConservation (2023),  “The White-bellied Heron is a very large brownish grey heron.” As it’s name suggests, the heron is characterized as having feathers in a variety of gray tones, as well as a whitish foreneck and underbelly. It is said by the HeronConservation (2023) that in terms of biology, little is known about the white-bellied heron.<br><br>

And, because little is known about this bird, there is no definitive answer to how or why it is vital to people and the environment. Despite their small numbers, they are a food source in some locations. (IUCN Red List, 2018) <br><br>

But I believe that If these herons become extinct, it will have an influence on the biodiversity of our ecosystem. it would cause the ecosystems it is connected to to become less productive, maybe to the point where they stopped producing altogether. <br><br>

The heron is categorized as severely endangered due to its small and rapidly declining population and habitat degradation brought on by lowland forests and wetlands harmed by human activities such as direct logging and disturbance.<br><br>

            According to Animalia.org (n.d.). Due to the conversion of wetlands for agriculture and the growth of settlements, habitat loss, rising disturbance, and habitat degradation, as well as the collection of wetland resources and poaching, the white-bellied heron is in danger. In Bangladesh, it may also be locally extinct. In Bhutan, four sizable hydroelectric projects are situated in key white-bellied heron habitat, and rivers are used for sand and gravel mining. Forest fires have a negative impact on nesting places. <br><br>


Schedule 1 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972 provides legal protection for the white-bellied heron in India. It has had the highest level of legal protection in Myanmar since 1994. Since 2007, the IUCN Red List has classed it as Critically Endangered because the global population is thought to be less than 250 adult individuals and rapidly falling. <br><br>

In the report of Indra Prasad Acharja, director of RSPN's section for species and habitat protection, stated that the conversion of key rivers for hydropower, increase of agriculture, and development for tourism pose serious risks to herons in Bhutan. The habitat of the white-bellied heron is also threatened where natural riverine ecosystems still exist because of the exploitation of resources like wood, sand, and stones as well as the loss of prey owing to overfishing. Hunting and noise pollution brought on by road construction are other hazards to herons. <br><br>

White-Bellied Heron - The white-bellied heron is undermined by territory misfortune, expanding unsettling influence and territory corruption due to transformation of wetlands for farming and development of settlements, collecting of wetland assets and poaching.  The species is now only found in northern Myanmar, northeast India, and Bhutan, according to the conservation NGO BirdLife International, with Nepal and Bangladesh potentially following suit (Gyelmo, D. 2021, July 26). <br><br>

Cows - The human activities on cows is that they breed and take care of cows until they are fully grown to squeeze out the milk from cows to make dairy products that we use everyday. Cows are also used for materials because of their leather, their meat is also used to make delicious dishes like roast beef and many more. Cows also help in different farming activities. One of these examples is eating grass that is already too long and their feces acts as a fertilizer for the plants. Some ways to protect and conserve cows is by not feeding at the gate or in your pens. Don’t let your cows get used to being fed near pasture fences or in a barn. It just trains the cows to a place where it is easier for criminals to catch them. Another way is by locking all your gates so that criminals will have a hard time capturing your cows and you will eventually catch them trying to break in. (Lipson, J., Reynolds, T., & Anderson, L. 2011)

            Cattle handling is a dangerous and a risky activity on dairy farms, and cows are the primary cause and source of injuries to livestock handlers. Possibly the most significant livestock species is the cow. The loss of genetic variety within this species has been a major worry since the turn of the century because it might have a substantial impact on its capacity to adapt to future production limits stated by (Bolaji U. et al., 2021). <br><br>

Habitat degradation is one of the biggest threats the world is receiving and this is the result of human activities. The landscape gets adjusted and modified the more the population increases, the more trees get chopped down for more resources to be able to maintain our modern lifestyle. Energy consumption has increased in response to this development, fueling global climate change. The speed of climate change will outstrip certain species' inherent capacity to adapt to survive according to (Bolaji U. et al., 2021).
